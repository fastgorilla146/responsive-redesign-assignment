    <h3>
      WebAIM WAVE Analysis: 
      </h3>
    <p class="p">
    
      There were a few problems pointed out by the WebAIM WAVE. First off, there are 
      no headings making it so there is no cohesive structure to the site. All the content 
      is also in an unordered list with many cases of very small text. This is a problem 
      since there is barely any content on the page so it being very small makes the page 
      look awkwardly spaced. Overall, however, there was not many errors with the page, 
      but that can be contributed to the very small amount of content on the page.
